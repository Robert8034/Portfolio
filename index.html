My go to programming language currently is C#, however I am also proficient in Java, HTML, CSS, .Net, SQL and a handfull of frameworks. To see a more in depth list of skills I would suggest checking out the <a href=workingexperience.html>Working Experience</a> page</h2>

Working in retail sales and computer repairs for a number of years made me customer focused and a great listener. Next to that I also enjoy public speaking. Stuff like presenting new projects or updating the stakeholders of a current project is something that I enjoy doing. This is why in most projects, you will likely see me take on a leadership role.</h2>
